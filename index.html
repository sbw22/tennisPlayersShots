                                    <p>Juan Martín del Potro has one of the best forehands in the history of tennis. Few can match the power he generates on this stroke. He uses an eastern grip that he generates a flat ball with, and uses minimal wrist movement on his take-back and general motion of the swing to add to the flatness of his ball. Along with his 6'6 height, it is easy to see why Quan Martín del Potro has one of the best forehands in the game!</p>

His fastest recorded serve is 157.2 mph, and his first serve percentage is an astounding 72 percent!

He consistantly hits 133 mph serves and once hit 46 aces in the second round of Wimbledon in 1997. He incorporates a low ball toss and an early hit of the ball (sometimes before it hits the peak) in his deadly serve.</p>

Although he does not come to the net as his primary way to finish points, they are certainly on another level. He has world class footwork, racket positioning, and balance. However, a signature part of Federer's volley is his head position. His head stays perfectly still as he hits the ball and his eyes stay glued onto the ball until contact point. </p>
